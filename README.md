exscript.sh is a bash script that copies a directory into a directory called "esame_abinfo_bresciani", which is created if it doesn't already exist. the script asks for three things: 
	directory current name--> the current name of the directory that needs to be copied, e.g. data
	directory current location--> the path for the current location of the directory, e.g. if data 		is /home/carolina/Scaricati/data the program needs /home/carolina/Scaricati
	if you want to change the name of the directory after it has been copied
	
progexam.ipynb is the python notebook to analize the data. do not run this program with all 10'000 measures if you're in a rush.
